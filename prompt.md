Use my GitHub profile (https://github.com/luongnv89) as the content source and redesign my personal page into a lightweight, professional portfolio for a senior AI & cybersecurity
software engineer. Deliver a design specification plus a minimal starter codebase in React (Vite + Bun), Tailwind CSS, shadcn‑ui, and lucide‑icons.

**Design constraints**

- **Color palette**: only Black, White, Gray, and Bright Green.
- **Mode support**: fully functional dark and light themes.
- **Aesthetic**: clean, elegant, and professional.
- **Visual depth**: use blocks, lines, borders, and subtle shadows to create a 3‑D effect.
- **Bright Green usage**: exclusively for highlights (text, borders, lines); never a background.
- **System status colors**: danger, info, warning colors may appear only in text, not as backgrounds or primary components.
- **Responsiveness**: fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**Required output**

1. **Design specification**
   - Section layout (e.g., Hero, About, Projects, Skills, Contact).
   - Component list with brief descriptions and Tailwind class names.
   - Color usage table (background, text, border, shadows).
   - Accessibility notes (contrast, focus styles).

2. **Starter code**
   - File structure (`src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/assets`).
   - Tailwind configuration with custom colors.
   - Sample component snippets (Hero, ProjectCard, Footer).

Keep the response concise but complete—no boilerplate or role definitions.
